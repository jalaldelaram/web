            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p align="justify">
				Strategic Management is a critical discipline that guides organizations in formulating, implementing, and evaluating strategies to achieve long-term success and competitive advantage. In today’s fast-paced and competitive business environment, strategic management is essential for businesses to adapt to market dynamics, technological changes, and evolving customer demands. The field addresses key elements such as market positioning, resource allocation, risk management, and organizational culture, helping leaders make informed decisions that drive business growth. It provides the tools for identifying opportunities, tackling challenges, and ensuring that all aspects of an organization align with its overarching vision and goals, ultimately ensuring sustainability in the long run.
				<br>
				This field emerged as a formal field in the 1960s, influenced by scholars like Igor Ansoff and Michael Porter, who introduced models such as the SWOT analysis and Porter’s Five Forces. These frameworks became foundational to modern business strategies and remain in use today. As businesses continue to face disruptions from digital transformation, globalization, and the rise of new business models, the future of strategic management will likely see a greater emphasis on agility, innovation, and data-driven decision-making. The integration of artificial intelligence, big data, and strategic foresight will revolutionize how businesses assess risks, capitalize on emerging trends, and align their strategies to rapidly changing environments.
