        <h2 class="research-title">Research Interests</h2>
        <p class="research-intro">
            My research focuses on the application of <strong>Game Theory</strong>, <strong>Mechanism Design</strong>, <strong>Operations Research</strong>, 
            <strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>, and <strong>Time Series Analysis</strong> to solve complex challenges across various fields, 
            including:
        </p>
        <ul class="research-intro">
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>: Using optimization and game-theoretic models to improve efficiency, reduce costs, 
            and enhance resilience in global supply chains.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Design</strong>: Applying mechanism design and game theory to create efficient, fair, and transparent market 
            systems, including auctions, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Humanitarian Aid Systems</strong>: Developing decision-making models and logistics strategies for effective 
            resource allocation and disaster relief operations to maximize social impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Economics</strong>: Using statistical and game-theoretic methods to model and analyze economic systems, focusing on 
            resource distribution, market dynamics, and policy analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Operations Management</strong>: Leveraging operations research, time series analysis, and statistical methods to optimize 
            production systems, forecasting, and scheduling in manufacturing and service industries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="ongoing-title">Ongoing Projects</h2>
        <p class="ongoing-description">
            My ongoing projects include developing advanced mathematical models for optimizing resource allocation, 
            designing efficient mechanisms for partner selection in supply chains, and creating sustainable logistics frameworks 
            for humanitarian operations. These projects aim to contribute to both the theoretical and practical dimensions of 
            Industrial Engineering, driving innovation in complex systems and networks.
